Why would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
  all your work local?

  - Allow collaboration and use of other computer to work across.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
  Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  - May not want to push what you have made or could lead to many more
    commits and a cluttered history
